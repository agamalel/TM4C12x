TM4Cx Embedded Projects

- i use TExaSdisplay.exe generally for UART connection and debugging purposes.
- All of the projects have been tested and compiled using Keil (mdk473).
- for the Matrix KeyPad4x4 project unfortunately i didn't write down the pin order i may be do it later, if you tried it, please     add it to the project.
- The spaceInvader code exists under the /4C123/ directory.
- if you are going to learn and follow my coding approach you should always consider using the startup.asm file i am using and      not the defualt keil one.
- for further information do not hestitate for contacting me on: momen.1993@live.com.
