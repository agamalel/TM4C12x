- i used keil in all of this projects.
- TExaSdisplay.exe is a multifunction program i mainly use it for connecting UART but it you can use it as oscilliscope 
  but you will need to use TExaS_Grader() in your code and the .dll of TExaS

- For the Matrix4x4 Device Driver project the code works with a specific pin arrangement i forget to write down in the 
  code (sorry) but it works appropriately when you wiring it right (tested) if you happened to figure it out yourself, 
  please update porject.
